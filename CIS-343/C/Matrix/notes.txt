Notes for the assignment.

Only edit matrix.c

Fuck memory allocation
Fuck C

The data in each matrix is actually stored as a 1D array
even though there are rows and columns

to access an element: do array[row*columns + column]
where:
	row is a local variable, the row you want to access
	column is a local variable, the column you want to access
	columns is a STATIC variable belonging to the struct.
